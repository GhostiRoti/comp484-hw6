        <h2>Google Certified UX Designer || Programmer || Unity Certified Game Developer || Sick Gamer >:D</h2>
        <p> 8 years of Programming, 2 years of UX Design, 2 years of Game Development. Life long problem solver.
            I'm a skilled leader, quick learner, and motivated team player.
            I speak English and French and know many programming languages including C#, Java, C++, RUST, and more.
            Currently on my Junior Year as a student at California State University Northridge. I'm also pretty good at video games.
            The highlights of my life to date have always been part of a team.
            It's these moments I perform my best work, because I'm deeply motivated to make a team succeed.
            I love helping others, and doing my part for everyone to reach their goals.
            My ambitions are to gain a master's in computer science, develop culture/language learning applications, and to one day have the resources to develop my dream video game.

            <h3>UX Designer</h3>
            <p>Friends of Chimps</p>
            <p>October 2024 - Present</p>
            
            <!-- Add as many paragraphs as you need. -->
            <p> Worked as a Team Manager and currently UX designer/web engineer for Friends of Chimps and their website.
                I adopted these roles when it was clear these critical needs were missing.
                As Team manager I created guidelines for programmers, UX designers, graphic designers, and team coordinators to follow in order to keep tasks running smoothly.
                I also performed user research, and designed pages for the new website along side my teammates.
                I then orchestrated tests, layed out operation and approval pipelines, reviewed work of the different teams, and managed deligation for data security (I did not consult nor work on data security).
